# Healthy Food API
Healthy Food API is designed to create a meal plan for a day based on dietary restrictions. 
The objective of this application is to fetch different meals and let the user add the meals to meal planner.
The meals are based on total amount of calories per day, the type of diet and list of ingredients user wants to exclude from his meals.

* Example of Diet :  vegan, vegetarian, keto, Dairy-free, gluten-free etc
* Example of Exclusion :  nuts, mushrooms, peanut, eggs, fish, shellfish etc

# Research & Analysis
We started with defining what our MVP will be. After doing the initial research ,we came up with the following features for our MVP :

* Get list of ingredients to be used for exclusion list
* Get list of diets (Gluten-free, Dairy-free, Vegetarian,...)
* Get list of meals
* Create meal plan based on meals IDs and a day
* Get meal plan based on user id 
* Decided to store all the data in the backend using MySql database.
* Setup an AWS Database.

This diagram shows the high-level functions and scope of our application.

### Class Diagram to exhibit the flow from Controller to Service and Repository

The classes are designed in MVC pattern
* Controller will have classes related to endpoints. 
* Service will have interfaces to call the CRUD repository methods
* Repository has the interfaces related to CRUD

### Class Diagram for Model

These classes make use of Lombok annotations and JPA
* The MealIngredientAs class will contain all the ingredients for a particular meal.
* We query the above table excluding the ingredients which matches the Exclusion list.
* The list of Meal will be returned and further we filter it according to the category and diet.
* This list of Meals is sent to the User.
* User can select meals and add them to particular date as a request.
* Now we insert the selected meal and date inside the MealPlan table.
* We retrieve the saved mealPlan according to the userid.
